# ðŸŒŠ Kanagawa Hypr Dots ðŸŒŠ
Collection of personal configs, desktop environment settings and editors preferences. Mostly based on [Simple Hyprland](https://github.com/gaurav23b/simple-hyprland/tree/879dba81c84134072826a21453c15e553d03da2d).

##### Key Changes
* [split monitor workspaces](https://github.com/Duckonaut/split-monitor-workspaces) plugin to assign distinguish workspaces (four) per display
* F1-F4 to switch between workspaces
* CONTROL as mainMod key (it's less freaky than use SUPER and break fingers all the time)
* CONTROL + Digits || CONTROL + SHIFT + Arrows as an alternative way to switch between workspaces
* SUPER + S to open scratchpad
* Hardware cursor lag fix
* Color theme adjustments to match [Kanagawa Wave](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) palette, rather than Catppuccin
* No Kvantum. QT and GTK applications styled by separate fine tuned themes via ngw-look and qt6ct-kde.
* Single hypr.config file, no includes.
* Other minor fixes and tweaks
