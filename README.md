# ðŸŒŠ Kanagawa Hypr Dots ðŸŒŠ
Collection of personal configs, desktop environment settings and editors preferences. Mostly based on [Simple Hyprland](https://github.com/gaurav23b/simple-hyprland/tree/879dba81c84134072826a21453c15e553d03da2d).

##### Key Changes
* [split monitor workspaces](https://github.com/Duckonaut/split-monitor-workspaces) plugin to assign distinguish workspaces (four) per display
* F1-F4 to switch between workspaces
* CONTROL as mainMod key (it's less freaky than use SUPER and break fingers all the time)
* CONTROL + Digits || CONTROL + SHIFT + Arrows as an alternative way to switch between workspaces
* SUPER + S to open scratchpad
* Hardware cursor lag fix
* Color theme adjustments to match [Kanagawa Wave](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) palette, rather than Catppuccin
* No Kvantum. QT and GTK applications styled by separate fine tuned themes via ngw-look and qt6ct-kde.
* Single hypr.config file, includes are for sickfucks.
* Other minor fixes and tweaks

## Installation
These dots are not meant to be used by someone else, since they're highly customized to my personal preferences, but if you still willing to try these, just clone repo and replace configs you're interested with.
