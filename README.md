# ðŸŒŠ Kanagawa Hypr Dots ðŸŒŠ
Collection of personal configs, desktop environment settings and editors preferences. Mostly based on [Simple Hyprland](https://github.com/gaurav23b/simple-hyprland/tree/879dba81c84134072826a21453c15e553d03da2d).

##### Key Changes
* [split monitor workspaces](https://github.com/Duckonaut/split-monitor-workspaces) plugin to assign distinguish workspaces (four) per display
* F1-F4 to switch between workspaces
* CONTROL as mainMod key (it's less freaky than use SUPER and break fingers all the time)
* Hardware cursor lag fix
* Color theme adjustments to match [Kanagawa Wave](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) palette, rather than Catppuccin
* No Kvantum. QT and GTK applications styled by separate fine tuned themes via `ngw-look` and `qt6ct-kde`
* No includes, single `hypr.config` file

## Installation
These dots are not meant to be used by someone else, as they are highly customized to my personal preferences. However, if you are still willing to try, just clone the repo and replace the configs you are most interested in. Hopefully at some point there will be a shell installation script.

Additionally, check [Post Install Check List](https://github.com/shayaharuno/dotfiles/blob/master/CHECKLIST.md) for clean Arch + Hyprland installation
